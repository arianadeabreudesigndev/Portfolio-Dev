    "about-description-tailane": "Since childhood, I've been self-taught, exploring different software on my own and naturally discovering my affinity for design, programming and games. Curiosity turned into practice, and practice became a passion for creating digital solutions that combine aesthetics and functionality.<br><br>My journey hasn't been simple. I grew up in a rural area with limited resources, but that never stopped me from seeking knowledge. I earned a spot at a federal university in the Information Systems program, where I made it through to my final year. I plan to resume and complete my degree next year, further consolidating my education, though I have already pursued others along the way.<br><br>I continue to grow with dedication in design and technology, creating useful and well-crafted digital experiences. This portfolio was entirely developed by me, from designing each page in Figma to the final implementation with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, built on solid foundations, the well-done basics, reinforcing my commitment to consistent development on the path to becoming a senior Full Stack developer.",

I use Java in personal projects and always choose the technology according to the project’s needs.",
    "skill-desc-sql": "One of my greatest interests in the IT field. I learned it in college, from modeling (1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal forms) to implementation. I spent hours exploring Beekeeper and worked as a Database Intern at Unimed, an experience that reinforced my passion for data modeling and administration. I still aim to deepen my knowledge much further, possibly even pursuing a DBA path in the future.",
    "skill-desc-php": "I have been using PHP since approximately 2021–2022, with my first contact during college, especially in the study of Object-Oriented Programming.

I also have experience with regular expressions (regex). It is a language I feel comfortable with, especially in academic and utility contexts.",
    "skill-desc-django": "I have been working with Django for about 5 years and use the framework according to the project’s requirements. I usually choose Django when organization, productivity, and database integration are needed. I have developed projects using the technology and am familiar with its ecosystem and development workflow for web applications.",
    "skill-desc-typescript": "I have been using TypeScript for several years and have been increasingly deepening its use in recent projects. The language has become an important part of my workflow, as it facilitates code organization, predictability, and maintenance of more complex JavaScript projects. I hold a specific course and apply TypeScript mainly in web and back-end projects, focusing on structure and code quality.",

    "project2-description-detailed": "This project was one of the first I developed in college and it marked my learning process with HTML and CSS Grid. I created an interactive periodic table where each element works as a button that, when clicked, reveals a window displaying the symbol, the name, a brief description, and four images showing where the element can be found or how it is used in everyday life. It was a fun and challenging exercise that helped me better understand layout organization and make the content more engaging and accessible.",

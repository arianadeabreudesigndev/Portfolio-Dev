      "about-description-tailane": "Since childhood, I've been self-taught, exploring different software on my own and naturally discovering my affinity for design, programming and games. Curiosity turned into practice, and practice became a passion for creating digital solutions that combine aesthetics and functionality.<br><br>My journey hasn't been simple. I grew up in a rural area with limited resources, but that never stopped me from seeking knowledge. I earned a spot at a federal university in the Information Systems program, where I made it through to my final year. I plan to resume and complete my degree next year, further consolidating my education, though I have already pursued others along the way.<br><br>I continue to grow with dedication in design and technology, creating useful and well-crafted digital experiences. This portfolio was entirely developed by me, from designing each page in Figma to the final implementation with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, built on solid foundations, the well-done basics, reinforcing my commitment to consistent development on the path to becoming a senior Full Stack developer.",

That's why I developed an intense focus on maintaining balanced mental and physical health, reconciling with my unrestricted interest in technology.<br><br>The idea of transforming my personal blog into a community was born in 2025.

The design of this portfolio was entirely made by me in Figma. Moreover, I redesigned the portfolio and plan to implement it along with new best practices I have learned. You can check it in the portfolio repository.",
      "skill-desc-github": "I have been using it since before college for code versioning and collaboration. Nowadays, I also explore other similar tools, such as Bitbucket, to improve my workflow.",
      "skill-desc-html": "I have been familiar with it since childhood, when I learned empirically how to edit web pages. At that time, AdBlock didn’t exist, so I used to remove YouTube ads by directly deleting the entire element in the page’s HTML. Today I have a solid foundation, but I still strive to further improve the quality of my code. I have read books such as Efficient CSS from Casa do Código, The HTML Bible, among others, and I continue to study best practices to make the most out of each tag and feature, starting with refactoring this portfolio in the future.",
      "skill-desc-css": "I learned it in college and I’m always looking to stay up to date. I enjoy applying best practices for responsive design and style organization. I must say I’m eager to implement better practices in this portfolio, as I have just completed an in-depth CSS course focused on optimal usage and I plan to take more in the future.",
      "skill-desc-java": "I know developers shouldn’t have a favorite language, since they must be able to implement logic regardless of it, but I must say Java is a dear friend. I found it easier to work with than any other. I constantly strive to improve my practices and expand my knowledge, but without limiting myself to using it for everything. In fact, I even avoid it. My first contact with it was in college.",
      "skill-desc-sql": "It is one of my greatest interests in the IT field. I learned it in college, from modeling (1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form) to implementation. I spent hours exploring Beekeeper and even worked as a Database Analyst at Unimed, an experience that strengthened my passion for data modeling and administration. I still want to dive much deeper into it, perhaps even pursuing the DBA path in the future.",

      "skill-desc-react": "My first contact with React Native was in an extension course at HackTruck. Currently, I study React with a focus on developing and consuming APIs, applying it in my own projects. The main one is not listed yet.",
      "skill-desc-python": "It was the second language I learned in college. I appreciate its simplicity and productivity, including features like lambda. Although I don’t use OOP much in Python (as I don’t feel very comfortable with it in this language), I am familiar with it and can develop projects when needed.",
      "skill-desc-django": "I was introduced to it in college and have been deepening my knowledge through courses and personal projects, as an alternative to what I was already doing with relational databases.",
      "skill-desc-node": "I was introduced to it during college, but only later did I start exploring it in depth. I enjoy the flexibility it offers for building agile back-ends, especially when used with Express and databases.",
      "skill-desc-typescript": "I have been delving into it more recently, mainly to improve the quality and predictability of my JavaScript code. Using static typing has helped me identify errors before runtime and keep projects better organized. I am applying it in personal projects and plan to expand its use in production in the future.",

      "project2-description-detailed": "This project was one of the first I developed in college and it marked my learning process with HTML and CSS Grid. I created an interactive periodic table where each element works as a button that, when clicked, reveals a window displaying the symbol, the name, a brief description, and four images showing where the element can be found or how it is used in everyday life.
